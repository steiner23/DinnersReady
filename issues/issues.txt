           // unitOfMeasure = unitOfMeasure.Replace("\t", "");
           // unitOfMeasure = unitOfMeasure.Replace("(", "");
          //  unitOfMeasure = unitOfMeasure.Replace(")", "");
          //  unitOfMeasure = unitOfMeasure.Remove(0, 1);
          //  unitOfMeasure = unitOfMeasure.Trim();

also that ingredient temperatures are a number (and Gas Marks 1 - 8 ?)
